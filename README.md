# IBM Data Analytics Capstone Project

In this project I took a role of a recently hired Data Analyst by a global IT and business consulting firm that is known for their expertise in IT solutions and their team of highly experienced IT consultants. In order to keep pace with changing technologies and remain competitive, the organization regularly analyzes data to help identify future skill requirements.

As a Data Analyst, I was tasked with collecting data from various sources and identifying trends for this year's report on emerging skills. 

### First Task

Collect the top programming skills that are most in demand from various sources including:

	Job postings <br />
	Training portals <br />
	Surveys <br />

### Second Task

analyze the data and identify insights and trends that may include the following:

	What are the top programming languages in demand? <br />
	What are the top database skills in demand? <br />
	What are the popular IDEs? <br />

## Step 1: Collecting Data
